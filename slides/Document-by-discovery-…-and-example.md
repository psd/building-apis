Building a Website which exposes the data through links, and services through HTML forms encourages exploration and leads to [discovery through hypertext](http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven).
Provide documentation for your API using examples.
Collect how people are using your API, especially link to any open source projects for projects, wrappers and programming language libraries.
Provide simple ways to experiment, as with [The Guardian API explorer](http://explorer.content.guardianapis.com/).
