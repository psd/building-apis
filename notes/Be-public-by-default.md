# Notes
Publish open data under a permissive licence.

Lower the barriers to others using your data; don't demand registration or API keys for public data.

Open data increases the number of people able to use your data and service, and leads to feedback loops where consumers become motivated to resolve issues at source, feeding back issues and correction to your service and the data within.

Where content is sensitive, or requires authentication, use encryption (HTTPS) and a standard authentication such as [Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) or [OAuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth), depending upon the sensitivity of your content.

As a publisher it's simple to publish and you do not have answer requests for data or repeatedly explain to others that they can use your data.
Increases discovery, means consumers can easily find, see, print, share, copy, modify and build upon data.
Building virtuous feedback loops for data; value of data increases more people who use it.

The Open Web Application Security Project ([OWASP](https://www.owasp.org)) maintains a large repository of security information applicable to building APIs, a including a [REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet).
