Consider an API to be a part of a Web site.
Provide links to machine-friendly formats from human readable pages,
and enable agents to easily construct URLs which link to human-friendly representations of pages.

Use standard formats for content, and follow established Web patterns for authentication.

Building a service to enjoy mass adoption and support from a wide disparate community of developers and programming environments whilst being able to reach a world-wide audience is difficult.
Whilst proprietary and open technologies abound for machine-to-machine communication, none combine the interoperability, reach and ability to scale to compete with The Web.

## Why
Standards are powerful agreements, and nowhere are agreements more quickly established and adopted than on The Web.
Using HTTP and URIs, the core technologies of The Web, together with emergent standards such as [JSON](http://www.json.org/) and [OAuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) changes a Website from [a retail shop window into a wholesaler](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/resource-library/directgov-2010-and-beyond-revolution-not-evolution), meeting our design principle to [Build digital services, not websites](https://www.gov.uk/designprinciples#eighth).
