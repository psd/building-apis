# Building APIs by building on APIs

A [talk](http://qconlondon.com/london-2013/presentation/Building%20APIs%20by%20building%20on%20APIs) for [Qcon London 2013](http://qconlondon.com/london-2013).

> In 2011, Martha Lane Fox published an influential report on the state of for Government, advocating "revolution, not evolution" and calling for government to act as a "wholesaler as well as the retail shop front for services and content by mandating the development and opening up of Application Programme Interfaces (APls) to third parties". This talk is a tour of the UK Government Digital Service API Design Principles, the lessons learnt from building the GOV.UK publishing platform and transactional services on APIs, and how these design principles are now being applied to enable departments and agencies across government to transform transactions and services into becoming "digital by default".
